Import dbpedia dump into neo4j.

The required input files are downloadable at http://downloads.dbpedia.org/3.9/en/

Please setup an appropriate filter in the resource file "filter.properties" first, 
unless you are interested in Egyptian pharaoh! The filtering restrict the amount 
of node created.

Dbpedia input file such as "article_templates_en.nt", contains triple matching 
the pattern {node-to-create,wikiPageUsesTemplate,Template:some-template} so 
your filter must look like "Template\:some-template:wikiPageUsesTemplate" if you 
are interested in creating such a node using <i>some-template</i>. The same goes for the 
input "article_categories_en" matching {node-to-create,subject,Category:some-category} 
where a filter like "Category\:some-category:subject" should be used.

Run `org.acaro.dbpedia4neo.inserter.Creator` on "article_templates_en.nt" or 
article_categories_en.nt to initialise a set of node.
Then add properties and relationship to them by running 
`org.acaro.dbpedia4neo.inserter.Updater` with "mappingbased_properties_cleaned_en.nt".

These import step require quite some time (~5 and 20 minutes respectively for me) 
to import the two 3Go uncompressed input file. Since node creation is based on 
custom uids, neo4j will start by allocating a lot of disk space (18Go for the 
default supplied filter) and there will not be an accurate estimation of the 
amount of node in the graph available.

Have a look at the graph created with org.acaro.dbpedia4neo.web.Admin.
